Do not put the battery into your mouth. Do not let the battery contacts touch another metal object. Turn off the product before removing the battery. Performance depends on temperatures, signal strength, usage patterns, features selected and voice or data transmissions. Only Sony service partners should remove or replace built-in batteries. Use of batteries that are not Sony branded may pose increased safety risks. Replace the battery only with another Sony battery that has been qualified with the product per the standard IEEE-1725. Use of an unqualified battery may present a risk of fire, explosion, leakage or other hazard.</p>
