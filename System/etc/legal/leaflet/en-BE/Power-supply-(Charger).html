	<h1>Power supply (Charger)</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Connect the charger to power sources as marked on the product. Do not use outdoors or in damp areas. Do not alter or subject the cord to damage or stress. Unplug the unit before cleaning it. Never alter the plug. If it does not fit into the outlet, have a proper outlet installed by an electrician. When a power supply is connected there is a small drain of power. To avoid this small energy waste, disconnect the power supply when the product is fully charged. Use of charging devices that are not Sony branded may pose increased safety risks.</p>
