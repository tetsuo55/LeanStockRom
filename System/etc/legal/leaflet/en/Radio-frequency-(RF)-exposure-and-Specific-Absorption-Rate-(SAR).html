	<h1>Radio Frequency (RF) exposure and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)</h1>
	
	<div>
		<p>When the mobile device or Bluetooth handsfree functionality is turned on, it emits low levels of radio frequency energy. International safety guidelines have been developed through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies. These guidelines establish permitted levels of radio wave exposure. The guidelines include a safety margin designed to assure the safety of all persons and to account for any variations in measurements.</p>
		<p>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is used to measure radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile device. The SAR value is determined at the highest certified power level in laboratory conditions, but because the device is designed to use the minimum power necessary to access the chosen network, the actual SAR level can be well below this value. There is no proof of difference in safety based on difference in SAR value.</p>
		<p>Products with radio transmitters sold in the US must be certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). When required, tests are performed when the device is placed at the ear and when worn on the body. For body-worn operation, the device has been tested when positioned a minimum of <span class="keep-together">15 mm</span> from the body without any metal parts in the vicinity of the device or when properly used with an appropriate Sony accessory and worn on the body. When operating with “Hotspot” functionality engaged, a separation distance of 10 mm was used.</p>
